==========

The files for my thesis at Brown University.
When I was writing my thesis, there were relatively few well-written and sourced theses
to look back on.
Now mine is here.

This is written using the Brown University Thesis style files for LaTeX.

This thesis appears on the arXiv, and its various chapters have been published
or are being published (sometimes in a slightly different form) elsewhere.
